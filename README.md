# 🐹 Go-Lang-A-to-Z

A comprehensive guide to mastering the **Go Programming Language**, from fundamental syntax to advanced backend engineering.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

- [Installation & Setup](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Hello World](./DAY-1/hello.go)
- [Go Commands (run, build, install, mod)](./notes/commands.md)

---

## 🟦 Level 1: Basics (The Foundation)

- **Variables & Constants**: Primitive types, zero values, and inference.
- **Control Flow**: `if-else`, `switch`, and the versatile `for` loop.
- **Basic Types**: Integers, Floats, Booleans, and Strings.
- **Packages & Imports**: Organizing code and using `go mod`.

## 🟨 Level 2: Data Structures

- **Arrays & Slices**: Internal mechanics, `append`, and `copy`.
- **Maps**: Key-value pairs and hash-map internals.
- **Structs**: Custom types and anonymous structs.
- **Pointers**: Memory addresses, `&` and `*` operators.

## 🟩 Level 3: Logic & Functions

- **Functions**: Multiple returns, named returns, and variadic parameters.
- **Closures**: Anonymous functions and lexical scoping.
- **Methods**: Adding behavior to structs with value and pointer receivers.
- **Interfaces**: Implicit implementation and polymorphism.

## 🟧 Level 4: Concurrency (The Power of Go)

- **Goroutines**: Lightweight threading.
- **Channels**: Principles of "Don't communicate by sharing memory".
- **Select**: Handling multiple asynchronous operations.
- **Sync Package**: `WaitGroups`, `Mutexes`, and `Once`.

## 🟥 Level 5: Advanced & Production

- **Error Handling**: `error` interface, `panic`, `recover`, and wrapping.
- **Reflection**: Inspecting types at runtime using `reflect`.
- **Testing**: Unit tests, benchmarks, and table-driven testing.
- **Context**: Managing timeouts and cancellations in microservices.
- **Networking**: Building High-performance REST & gRPC APIs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Runtime**: Go 1.21+
- **IDE**: VS Code (with Go extension)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes
